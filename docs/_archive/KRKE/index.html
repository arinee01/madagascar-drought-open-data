          Constraint-Driven Creativity under Censorship
        </p>

        <p>
          Creativity is often imagined as an expression of freedom — an
          unrestricted flow of ideas, forms, and meanings. Yet historically and
          contemporarily, some of the most distinctive creative practices have
          emerged precisely under conditions of restriction. Political regimes,
          moral norms, institutional controls, and algorithmic systems have
          repeatedly attempted to regulate artistic and expressive production.
          Paradoxically, these constraints have not only suppressed creativity
          but have also reshaped it, giving rise to indirect, symbolic, and
          highly inventive forms of expression.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>ConCreCen</strong> (Constraint-Driven Creativity under
          Censorship) explores this tension. The project investigates how
          censorship functions simultaneously as a barrier and as a productive
          friction within creative processes. Rather than treating censorship
          solely as a negative external force, we model it as a complex system
          of constraints that interact with creators, media, technologies, and
          cultural contexts — sometimes silencing expression, sometimes
          stimulating innovation through indirection.

        <h2>Why Censorship and Creativity?</h2>
        <p>
          Across different historical periods and media environments, creators
          have repeatedly adapted their strategies in response to censorship:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <strong>authoritarian regimes</strong>, writers and artists have
            relied on allegory, metaphor, and coded language to convey
            prohibited meanings.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>popular culture</strong>, censorship has been
            aestheticized and strategically incorporated into artistic
            identities.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>contemporary digital platforms</strong>, AI-driven
            content moderation systems silently reshape creative behavior
            through algorithmic filtering, uncertainty, and self-censorship.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These cases suggest that censorship does not simply remove creative
          possibilities; it reconfigures the creative space itself, altering how
          ideas are formed, expressed, and interpreted.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Aim</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of ConCreCen is to develop an ontology-based framework that
          formally models:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>different types of censorship and constraints;</li>
          <li>
            creative processes and strategies developed in response to them;
          </li>
          <li>
            the social, historical, and technological contexts in which these
            dynamics occur;
          </li>
          <li>
            the consequences of censorship for creative production, ranging from
            suppression to innovation under constraint.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By representing these elements in a structured knowledge model, the
          project enables systematic analysis of how creativity operates under
          restriction — both in historical cases and in contemporary,
          AI-mediated environments.
        </p>

        <h2>From History to AI-Driven Censorship</h2>
        <p>
          ConCreCen deliberately spans multiple temporal and technological
          contexts. It connects well-documented historical cases of censorship
          in literature, art, and music with present-day forms of platform-based
          and AI-driven moderation. In doing so, the project highlights a
          critical shift: censorship is increasingly delegated to automated
          systems, whose opaque decision-making processes introduce new forms of
          constraint, uncertainty, and creative adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>This transition raises new questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How does algorithmic censorship differ from institutional or state
            censorship?
          </li>
          <li>
            What kinds of creative strategies emerge when creators must
            anticipate machine judgment?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can restriction imposed by AI systems unintentionally foster new
            forms of symbolic, visual, or memetic creativity?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodological Perspective</h2>
        <p>ConCreCen follows a knowledge-engineering approach grounded in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>theoretical work on creativity, constraints, and censorship;</li>
          <li>
            ontology design patterns and alignment with existing semantic
            resources;
          </li>
          <li>
            the construction of a knowledge graph combining historical and
            synthetic cases;
          </li>
          <li>
            exploratory experiments involving large language models (LLMs) for
            generation and evaluation under constrained conditions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Rather than offering a normative answer to whether censorship is
          “good” or “bad” for creativity, the project provides a formal
          analytical tool for examining how creativity adapts, transforms, or
          collapses under different forms of restriction.
        </p>

        <h2>A Core Insight</h2>
        <p>At the heart of ConCreCen lies a simple but powerful observation:</p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong
            >Censorship does not only restrict creativity — in certain
            conditions, it reorganizes and intensifies it.</strong
          >
        </div>
        <p>
          This ontology makes that insight explicit, traceable, and
          computationally explorable.

        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p>
          The <strong>ConCreCen project</strong> (Constraint-Driven Creativity
          under Censorship) investigates the complex and often paradoxical
          relationship between censorship, constraints, and creative production,
          with particular attention to contemporary forms of AI-driven
          censorship systems. While censorship is conventionally framed as a
          purely suppressive mechanism that limits freedom of expression and
          diminishes creative output, historical, sociological, and cognitive
          studies increasingly suggest a more nuanced dynamic: constraints may
          also function as productive frictions, stimulating indirect
          expression, divergence, and innovative creative strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project adopts the position that creativity should not be
          understood solely as a process unfolding under conditions of freedom,
          but rather as a situated, adaptive phenomenon, shaped by
          institutional, social, technological, and psychological pressures.
          Censorship, in this sense, constitutes a specific class of constraints
          that actively intervene in creative processes, influencing not only
          what can be expressed, but also how expression is structured, encoded,
          displaced, or transformed.
        </p>

        <p>
          ConCreCen aims to formalize this relationship through the construction
          of a domain ontology and knowledge graph that model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            different types of censorship (political, moral, religious,
            corporate, social, self-censorship),
          </li>
          <li>
            diverse mechanisms of enforcement, including traditional manual
            review and contemporary AI-powered content moderation,
          </li>
          <li>
            the creative processes and strategies developed in response to
            restrictive environments,
          </li>
          <li>
            and the resulting impacts on creativity, ranging from suppression
            and chilling effects to innovation under constraint and the
            emergence of alternative expressive forms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A central theoretical assumption underlying the project is that
          censorship does not merely block creativity, but often redirects it,
          encouraging the use of allegory, metaphor, genre displacement,
          symbolic protest, and underground or coded modes of expression. This
          assumption is supported both by historical cases—such as creative
          production under authoritarian regimes in the 20th century—and by
          contemporary digital contexts, where algorithmic filtering and
          predictive moderation systems reshape creative behavior on online
          platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Methodologically, ConCreCen follows an eXtreme Design (XD) and CLOWN
          (Context, Literature, Ontology, Workflow, Narrative) approach,
          combining theoretical research with iterative ontology engineering.
          The project integrates:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a theoretical framework drawing from creativity studies, censorship
            theory, and cultural history;
          </li>
          <li>
            the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate definitions,
            scenarios, and user stories that inform ontology design;
          </li>
          <li>
            a set of competency questions that articulate the reasoning goals of
            the ontology;
          </li>
          <li>
            and a structured dataset of historical, contemporary, and
            AI-mediated censorship cases, represented as RDF triples within a
            knowledge graph.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The ontology developed in ConCreCen serves a dual function. First, it
          acts as a conceptual and analytical framework for describing and
          comparing how different forms of censorship interact with creative
          agents, works, and processes across contexts. Second, it functions as
          an operational artifact that can be used to guide and evaluate AI
          systems: either by constraining generative models to produce creative
          outputs under specified censorship conditions, or by enabling
          evaluative tasks in which AI assesses creativity according to
          ontology-defined criteria.
        </p>

        <p>
          By explicitly modeling AI-driven government and platform censorship,
          including content moderation algorithms, surveillance systems, and
          predictive filtering mechanisms, ConCreCen addresses a critical
          contemporary shift in the governance of creative expression. These
          systems introduce new forms of scalability, opacity, and algorithmic
          bias, generating novel constraints that affect not only what content
          is removed, but how creators anticipate and adapt to automated
          judgment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, ConCreCen positions censorship as a structuring force
          within creative systems, rather than as an external anomaly. Through
          formal knowledge representation, the project demonstrates how
          constraints can simultaneously inhibit and activate creativity,
          revealing patterns of adaptation, divergence, and innovation that
          remain difficult to capture without an explicit ontological model.
        </p>

        <p>
          By making these dynamics explicit, ConCreCen contributes both to
          knowledge representation research and to broader discussions on
          creativity, cultural production, and AI governance, offering a
          reusable semantic framework for studying creativity under constraint
          in historical and contemporary settings.

      <!-- THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK SECTION -->
      <section id="theoretical-framework" class="section">
        <h1>Theoretical Framework</h1>

        <h2>Creativity as a Process under Constraints</h2>
        <p>
          Creativity has long been conceptualized not merely as the production
          of novel artifacts, but as a complex process shaped by cognitive,
          social, and environmental factors. Contemporary theories emphasize
          that creative production does not occur in a vacuum; rather, it is
          deeply influenced by contextual pressures, limitations, and
          constraints (Rhodes, 1961; Stokes, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
          Research on constraint-based creativity suggests that
          limitations—whether formal, material, or ideological—can play a
          productive role in creative thinking. Constraints reduce the space of
          possible solutions, forcing creators to explore unconventional paths,
          reinterpret existing forms, and develop indirect modes of expression.
          In this sense, constraints may stimulate divergent thinking by
          requiring creative agents to work "around" obstacles rather than
          within unrestricted expressive freedom (Stokes, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
          This perspective aligns with integrated models of creativity, such as
          those proposed in Aldo Gangemi's CreOn framework, which conceptualizes
          creativity as a situated process involving agents, goals, phases, and
          environmental pressures. Creativity emerges through interaction
          between individual intention and external conditions, including
          institutional and cultural limitations (Gangemi et al., 2021).
        </p>

        <h2>Forms of Censorship</h2>
        <p>
          Censorship represents a specific and historically persistent form of
          constraint on creative expression. It can be defined as the systematic
          restriction, modification, or suppression of expressive content by
          authoritative entities or internalized social norms (Petley, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
          Scholars commonly distinguish between several forms of censorship:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Political censorship, enforced by state institutions to control
            ideological narratives and public discourse;
          </li>
          <li>
            Moral and religious censorship, grounded in normative frameworks
            regulating acceptable representations of sexuality, violence, or
            belief;
          </li>
          <li>
            Corporate censorship, exercised by media companies and digital
            platforms through editorial policies and content moderation;
          </li>
          <li>
            Self-censorship, where creators internalize external pressures and
            preemptively limit their own expression (Foucault, 1977).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These forms often coexist and interact, producing layered constraint
          environments in which creative agents operate.
        </p>

        <h2>Censorship as Creative Pressure</h2>
        <p>
          While censorship is conventionally understood as a purely suppressive
          force, historical and sociological studies demonstrate a more
          ambivalent relationship between censorship and creativity. Under
          restrictive regimes, creators have frequently developed indirect
          expressive strategies—such as allegory, metaphor, symbolic
          abstraction, genre displacement, and formal experimentation—to convey
          prohibited meanings (Bourdieu, 1993; Petley, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
          In such contexts, censorship functions as a form of creative pressure
          or friction. Rather than eliminating expression altogether, it
          reshapes creative processes by privileging ambiguity, multi-layered
          interpretation, and coded communication. As a result, some cultural
          products created under heavy censorship exhibit high levels of formal
          innovation and interpretive complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This paradoxical effect—where restriction leads to
          innovation—constitutes a central theoretical assumption of the
          ConCreCen project.
        </p>

        <h2>From Historical to Algorithmic Censorship</h2>
        <p>
          In the 21st century, censorship has increasingly been mediated by
          algorithmic systems. Governments and digital platforms now rely on
          AI-driven content moderation, automated filtering, and predictive
          surveillance technologies to regulate expressive content at scale
          (Gillespie, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
          Algorithmic censorship introduces new dynamics into the relationship
          between constraints and creativity. While it enables unprecedented
          reach and efficiency, it also produces novel forms of uncertainty,
          such as false positives, opaque decision-making, and algorithmic bias.
          These conditions often intensify the chilling effect, encouraging
          widespread self-censorship among creators who cannot anticipate how
          automated systems will interpret their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, algorithmic censorship has prompted the emergence of
          new creative strategies, including visual obfuscation, coded language,
          meme-based communication, and platform-specific aesthetic adaptations.
        </p>

        <h2>Implications for Knowledge Representation</h2>
        <p>
          The diversity of censorship forms, creative strategies, and contextual
          conditions highlights the need for a structured and formal
          representation framework. Informal descriptions are insufficient to
          capture the complex relationships between censorship mechanisms,
          creative processes, and their outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By grounding the project in established theories of creativity and
          censorship, ConCreCen provides a conceptual foundation for modeling
          these interactions through an ontology and knowledge graph. This
          theoretical framework informs the design of classes, relations, and
          datasets developed in subsequent stages of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on this theoretical grounding, the project proceeds to an
          empirical and modeling phase. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
          employed to generate user stories, creative scenarios, and preliminary
          interpretations of censorship contexts. These narratives serve as the
          basis for defining competency questions, which guide the formal design
          of the ontology and the subsequent construction of the knowledge
          graph.

        <h2 id="kr-ontology">4.1 The Ontology</h2>
        <p>
          ConCreCen (Constraint-Driven Creativity under Censorship) formalizes
          constraint-driven creativity as an interaction between creative
          agents, creative works, enforcement authorities, and the constraints
          that shape production, circulation, and reception. The ontology models
          censorship not only as an external suppressive force, but as a
          structured set of constraints that can redirect creative processes and
          provoke adaptive strategies (e.g., allegory, coded language, genre
          shifts, visual obfuscation).
        </p>
        <p>
          We distinguish between institutional censorship (state, religious,
          corporate, social) and self-censorship, while extending the model to
          contemporary AI-driven moderation. This extension captures algorithmic
          mechanisms (e.g., keyword filtering, pattern recognition,
          pre-/post-publication review), their operational artifacts (e.g.,
          shadowbanning, throttling/downranking, automated removals), and side
          effects such as false positives and algorithmic bias.
        </p>

        <h2 id="kr-modeling">4.2 Modeling</h2>
        <p>
          The ontology was developed iteratively using a bottom-up extreme
          design approach. We started from narrative scenarios and user stories,
          derived competency questions (CQs), and then refined the TBox
          (classes) and properties until each CQ could be expressed as a SPARQL
          query over the resulting knowledge graph.

                As a writer working under restrictive political and technological
                conditions, I want to express ideas that challenge dominant
                narratives without triggering censorship mechanisms. I operate
                within an environment shaped by both institutional regulations
                and opaque algorithmic moderation systems. Explicit political
                critique risks bans, account suspension, or legal consequences.
                To navigate these constraints, I adopt creative strategies such
                as allegory, metaphor, and genre displacement. My goal is not
                only to avoid censorship but to communicate meaning to an
                informed audience capable of interpreting coded messages. I am
                constantly balancing expressive ambition with self-censorship,
                uncertainty, and adaptation. Understanding how different
                constraints shape creative outcomes would help me choose more
                effective strategies.

              In the late 1930s, a novelist living under an authoritarian regime
              in Southern Europe faces strict political censorship enforced by a
              state ministry of culture. Explicit criticism of the government
              and references to political repression are prohibited. The author
              writes a fictional novel set in a distant, imaginary kingdom where
              animals govern humans, using allegory to reflect real political
              dynamics...

                In the late 1930s, a novelist living under an authoritarian
                regime faces strict political censorship. Explicit criticism is
                prohibited; the author writes a novel set in an imaginary
                kingdom using allegory to reflect political dynamics, allowing
                subversive meanings to circulate without direct reference to
                real institutions.

          <p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
          <p>
            What creative strategies are associated with different types of
            censorship?
          </p>

          <p><strong>Finding</strong></p>
          <p>
            Based on the prototype scenario dataset, institutional censorship
            (government/religious) is most frequently associated with allegory,
            coded language, genre shifts, and underground distribution, while
            AI-driven and platform censorship is associated with visual
            obfuscation, memetic communication, and stylistic distortion.
            Self-censorship is primarily linked to omission and cautious
            framing.

            What outcomes are most common under different censorship mechanisms?

          <p><strong>Finding</strong></p>
          <p>
            Post-publication enforcement is associated with Removed /
            Shadowbanned / Banned outcomes, whereas pre-publication and
            predictive review are more often associated with Edited /
            AllowedWithChanges outcomes.

            Which contexts are associated with innovation under constraint vs.

          <p><strong>Finding</strong></p>
          <p>
            Innovation under constraint appears across both historical and
            contemporary cases, but suppression dominates in conflict and
            high-stakes state contexts. Platform contexts show mixed outcomes
            depending on mechanism opacity and false positives.

            In the prototype dataset, platform-facing media (visual art, digital
            posts, music distribution) show higher rates of
            <em>shadowbanning</em> and <em>removal</em>, while state-controlled
            contexts more frequently result in <em>bans</em> or

            Non-transparent barriers such as <em>shadowbanning</em> and

        <h1>Knowledge Extraction</h1>

        <p>
          Following the refinement of the ConCreCen ontology, we proceeded to
          validate the knowledge captured by the model through dataset
          instantiation and qualitative analysis. This stage operationalizes
          the ontology by populating it with concrete cases of
          constraint-driven creativity under censorship, allowing us to
          examine whether the defined classes, properties, and relations
          adequately represent real-world and historically grounded
          phenomena.
        </p>

        <p>
          This section first introduces the dataset used to instantiate the
          ontology, including the selection of seed cases and the use of
          LLM-assisted data augmentation. Subsequently, we present an initial
          descriptive analysis of the dataset to identify emerging patterns
          prior to formal SPARQL-based evaluation.
        </p>

        <h2>5.1 Dataset</h2>

        <h3>Dataset design and seed cases</h3>
        <p>
          In line with our bottom-up eXtreme Design methodology, the dataset
          construction began with a small set of seed cases that directly
          informed and validated the ontology’s structure. These initial
          cases were selected to reflect diverse historical periods,
          political contexts, media types, and censorship mechanisms,
          ensuring broad coverage of the conceptual space modeled by
          ConCreCen.
        </p>

        <p>The six seed cases include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Allegorical novel under totalitarian censorship (1930s
            Europe)</strong><br />A novelist employs allegory and symbolism
            to bypass state-imposed political censorship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Samizdat theatre under authoritarian surveillance (Cold
            War Eastern Europe)</strong><br />A theatre collective stages
            clandestine performances using coded language and underground
            distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Instrumental music under religious censorship (1990s
            Iran)</strong><br />A musician adapts musical form and genre to
            comply with religious restrictions on performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Journalistic literary reportage under wartime censorship
            (early 2000s)</strong><br />A journalist reframes factual
            reporting through personal narrative to avoid suppression.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital visual art under AI-driven moderation
            (contemporary platforms)</strong><br />An artist modifies visual
            style to evade automated nudity detection systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Screenwriting under predictive AI censorship (global
            streaming platforms)</strong><br />A writer adapts narrative
            structure using speculative fiction to pass algorithmic
            pre-screening.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These seed cases were iteratively enriched during ontology
          development and later served as anchors for generating additional
          instances.
        </p>

        <h3>LLM-assisted dataset augmentation</h3>
        <p>
          To expand the dataset beyond the initial seed cases, we employed a
          Large Language Model (LLM) to generate additional instances that
          conform to the ConCreCen ontological framework. The LLM was
          provided with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ontology schema (Turtle file)</li>
          <li>Structured descriptions of the six seed cases</li>
          <li>
            Explicit instructions to generate new cases by reusing existing
            classes and properties only
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This process resulted in a dataset of 24 creative instances,
          combining historically grounded cases and plausible contemporary
          scenarios. While the LLM successfully generated structurally
          coherent instances, manual review in Protégé revealed occasional
          omissions or underspecified relations, particularly regarding
          creative outputs and process granularity. These limitations are
          documented as part of the model’s evaluation rather than treated as
          errors.
        </p>

        <h3>Dataset structure (CSV)</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset was initially compiled in tabular form and later
          converted into RDF triples. The CSV schema reflects the
          ontology’s core classes and relations.

        <h3>5.1.1 Dataset Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          An initial descriptive analysis of the dataset reveals several
          notable patterns regarding censorship mechanisms, creative
          strategies, and outcomes.
        </p>

        <h4>Distribution of censorship types</h4>
        <p>Across the 24 instances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Institutional censorship (governmental, religious, corporate) appears in 14 cases</li>
          <li>AI-driven censorship appears in 7 cases</li>
          <li>Self-censorship is explicitly modeled in 9 cases, often co-occurring with institutional or algorithmic constraints</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This suggests that self-censorship frequently emerges as a
          secondary adaptive response rather than an isolated phenomenon.
        </p>

        <h4>Creative strategies under constraint</h4>
        <p>The most frequently observed creative strategies are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allegory / Metaphor strategies (10 cases)</li>
          <li>Genre shift and formal experimentation (8 cases)</li>
          <li>Visual obfuscation and coded language (7 cases)</li>
          <li>Underground distribution (6 cases)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While allegorical strategies dominate historically grounded cases,
          visual and formal strategies are more prevalent in AI-moderated
          digital environments.
        </p>

        <h4>Outcomes and impacts</h4>
        <p>The dataset shows a relatively balanced distribution of outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Approved or AllowedWithChanges: 9 cases</li>
          <li>Banned or Removed: 6 cases</li>
          <li>Shadowbanned / Downranked: 5 cases</li>
          <li>CirculatedUnderground: 4 cases</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Importantly, innovation under constraint is identified in 13
          cases, often co-occurring with partial suppression rather than
          outright approval. This supports the hypothesis that censorship
          does not exclusively suppress creativity but can redirect it toward
          alternative expressive forms.
        </p>

        <h4>Interpretation: constraints as creative structuring forces</h4>
        <p>
          The dataset analysis highlights a key distinction between
          constraint severity and creative outcome. High-severity constraints
          do not uniformly result in suppression; instead, they correlate
          strongly with the emergence of indirect, encoded, or formally
          experimental strategies. Conversely, AI-driven censorship tends to
          produce diffuse outcomes such as shadowbanning and throttling,
          contributing more frequently to chilling effects than to overt
          bans.
        </p>

        <p>
          These findings suggest that censorship operates not merely as a
          prohibitive force but as a structuring condition that shapes
          creative processes, media choices, and cultural circulation
          patterns—precisely the dynamic captured by the ConCreCen
          ontology.

        <h2>Probing the Black Box</h2>
        <p>
          We subjected models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) to a series of "borderline"
          prompts. The results map the "latent censorship" inherent in RLHF
          training, comparing it to historical codes of conduct.

          ConCreCen stands as a proof-of-concept that the "negative space"
          created by censorship is as information-rich as the content itself.
          Future iterations will visualize these constraint topologies in 3D
          space.
